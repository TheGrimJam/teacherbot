# Description

This is a python/django application designed to field chatbots written in AIML (via pandorabots) to twitter.

Extending this to involve more platforms should be fairly trivial if desired

If you are a public body interested in extending the work done here, creating your own bot platform, or just to share information on the successes and problems of the AI problems, feel free to get in touch ; sian.bayne@ed.ac.uk
